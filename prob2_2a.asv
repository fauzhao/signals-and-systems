% for filter command make sure the order of a and b vectors are correct
x=[1 2 3 4]
a1=[1]
b1=[0.5 1 2]
y1=filter(b1,a1,x)
% note that here y(1) was calculated by assuming n=1 and all the -ve values
% to be zero
% assume x(0) and x(-1) are zeros
% y(1)=0.5*x(1)+x(0)+2*x(-1)

a2=[1 -0.8]
b2=[2]
y2=filter(b2,a2,x)
a3=[1 -0.8]
b3=[0 2]
y3=filter(b3,a2,x)
